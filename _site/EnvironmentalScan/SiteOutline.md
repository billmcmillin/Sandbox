# DLF AIG Metadata Working Group Site Outline

This is the proposed reorganization of the DLF AIG Metadata Working Group output. This outline is to ensure we cover all work that is currently being done, as well as to help us plan our Jekyll changes/migration.

The .md / .html extensions to propose pages have been removed, as they will be dependent on the Jekyll migration regardless. Instead, the bolded portions are just indicated to be pages, further form (stand-alone html, post, include, other) to be determined.

## **index**: Introduction, Scoping, Overview (2016-2017)

Information on **index**, which is ultimately the homepage:

* DLF AIG Parent Organization
* Quality versus Assessment
* Procedure for public feedback + updates
* Areas of past, current & proposed work

## **Why**: Importance of Metadata Assessment (2017)

Information on **Why**, and this may get integrated with **index**:

* Proposed collaboration project with Analytics group
* Have filler section for now with proposed work mentioned

## **Scan**: Environmental scan (2016)

Information on **Scan**, which is largely the site information as it exists now in production:

* Procedure for updates
* Update form
* Zotero Usage
* Preliminary Material / Introduction to the Environmental Scan
* Environmental Scan parts (as posts? child pages?)

#### Organizations

* the Organizations section as exists now in production site homepage

#### Presentations

* the Presentations section as exists now in production site homepage

#### Publications

* the Publications section as exists now in production site homepage

#### Tools

* the Tools section as exists now in production site homepage

#### Citations

* the Citations section as exists now in production site homepage

#### Resources

* This is largely just a link to our contact information and a PDF download of the 2016 environmental scan. We may want to move this elsewhere in the new site, and eventually, have it give a link to the OSF repository download for the PDF.
* Contact information is definitely elsewhere in the new site.

## **Framework**:

This will shift as the Framework work continues and outputs shift.

For now, the top level page will have preliminary/introductory materials on the the purposes of the Framework, approaches to use, etc.

The following will be... child pages? posts? embedded? other?

#### Metadata assessment metrics (2016)

* Relate to origin in discussions of “quality” and environmental scan
* Also related to work on
* Relate to discussions/review of other work - including Europeana QA

#### Use cases for Metadata Assessment (2016)

* Originally meant to inform metadata assessment framework, give areas to target
* Responses / limitation thereof

#### Metadata Application Profile Guidelines (2017)

* Relate to origin in discussions of “quality” and environmental scan
* Also related to work on
* Relate to discussions/review of other work - including Europeana QA

#### Framework for performing metadata assessment // generic checklist for guidance (2016-7)

Should build off of above work and parallel work below

## **Tools**: Expanded tools recommendations (2016-?)

* Take work that fed into Environmental Scan and expand
* Site page will embed or link to Clearinghouse search interface

## **Profiles**: Metadata Profiles and Mappings Clearinghouse (2017)

* Site page will embed or link to Clearinghouse search interface, links to the work, repo, or just description of the output as decided.

## **Collaborations**: Collaborations with Other Groups (2017)

* List of collaborations with other groups as projects emerge.
* Way for groups to get involved if interested.

## **Glossary**: Glossary & References (2016-7)

* Glossary of terms used on the site.
* Seems appropriate to exist outside of the Framework page(s).

## **Contact & Get Involved**

* Take and expand what exists already.
* Might also be the right place to embed the update form.

## **About**

* Take and expand what exists already. May be wrapped up in the Introduction / Homepage section.

## **Sidebar** with site structure

* This will have to be regenerated elsewhere.
* This is an includes bit, not a page...?
* Is generated now based on Jekyll theme use of posts naming/metadata.
